# 🌀 Ball Maze Game

**Ball Maze Game** is a simple 3D game where the player guides a ball through a maze.  
This is my **first project built from scratch using OpenGL**, and it served as a hands-on way to apply and reinforce the core concepts I learned from books and online tutorials.

## 📚 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me understand and implement several foundational OpenGL concepts:

- ✅ The **Rendering Pipeline**  
- 🎨 Custom **Vertex and Fragment Shaders**  
- 🧱 Use of **VBOs (Vertex Buffer Objects)**, **VAOs (Vertex Array Objects)**, and **IBOs (Index Buffer Objects)**  
- 🔺 Drawing geometry and handling transformations  
- 🎮 Basic game loop, input handling, and collision logic

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **OpenGL** (Modern core profile)  
- **C++**  
- **GLFW / GLEW** 
- **GLM** for matrix/vector math

## 🎮 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Build the project using your preferred compiler or IDE  
3. Run the executable and guide the ball through the maze using keyboard controls

> Ensure you have all required dependencies installed before building.

## 📌 Notes

This project was a major milestone in my graphics programming journey. It’s intentionally kept minimal to focus on learning and implementation clarity.
This project isn't polished completely , ignore any bugs if found.
